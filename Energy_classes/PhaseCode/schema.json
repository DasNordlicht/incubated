  "description": "Adapted from CIM data models. Enumeration of phase identifiers. Allows designation of phases for both transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads. Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or split-phase, secondary circuits. For example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.",
