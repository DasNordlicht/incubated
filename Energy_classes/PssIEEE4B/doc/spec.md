## Description
The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type PSS2B power system stabilizer model. The PSS4B model represents a structure based on multiple working frequency bands. Three separate bands, respectively dedicated to the low-, intermediate- and high-frequency modes of oscillations, are used in this delta-omega (speed input) PSS.  Reference: IEEE 4B 421.5-2005 Section 8.4.
