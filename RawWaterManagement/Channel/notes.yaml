notesHeader:

This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic channel made for raw-water supply management of open-channel systems.

id: Unique identifier (required).
description: An optional text that describes other significant information about the channel.
tag: An optional text used to assign the channel to a category, perhaps one based on age or the served area.
length: The length of the channel. All units are accepted in CEFACT code.
geometry: Description of the geometry of a channel. Text defining the geometry of a channel. Values restricted to “Trapezoidal” (for open channels) or “Circular” (for pressurized flow).
bottomSlope: A sub-property.
leftSideSlope: A sub-property.
rightSideSlope: A sub-property.
bottomWidth: A sub-property.
maxWaterDepth: A sub-property.
diameter: A sub-property.
bottomSlope: The bottom slope of the channel in the case of “Trapezoidal” type. All units are accepted in CEFACT code.
leftSideSlope: The slope of the left bank of the channel in the case of “Trapezoidal” type. All units are accepted in CEFACT code.
rightSideSlope: The slope of the right bank of the channel in the case of “Trapezoidal” type. All units are accepted in CEFACT code.
bottomWidth: The bottom width of the channel in the case of “Trapezoidal” type. All units are accepted in CEFACT code.
maxWaterDepth: The maximum allowable water depth of the channel in the case of “Trapezoidal” type. All units are accepted in CEFACT code.
diameter: The diameter of the channel in the case of “Circular” of the channel. All units are accepted in CEFACT code.
roughnessCoefficient : The roughness coefficient of the channel. Manning’s coefficient for open channel flows or Surface roughness k for pipe flows.
flowType : Text defining the type of flow in the channel. Values restricted to "free surface flow" or "pressure-driven flow" or "flow with steep controls".
celerity: velocity of a surge propagated along the channel after the opening or close of a sluice gate.
timeTravel: the time travel of a surge from the downstream sluice gate to the upstream one.
waterLoss: (water leakages/losses - a flow number or a percentage of flow)

Channel Entity Relationships
downstreamNode: A relationship indicating the ID of the downstream node (junction, regulation structure) – where the channel ends.
upstreamNode: A relationship indicating the ID of the upstream node ((junction, regulation structure) – where the channel begins.
observedBy: A relationship to the device that provides the flow, velocity, depth, quality and waterOutflow property value. Reference to an entity of type Device.
