notesHeader:

This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic cross-section made for raw-water supply management domain. This entity is primarily associated with the water management vertical and related IoT applications. Act as computation point.

CrossSection Properties
id: Unique identifier (required).
description: An optional text that describes other significant information about the cross section.
tag: An optional text used to assign the cross section to a category, perhaps one based on age or the served area.

position: Description of relevant position of a cross section from a reference point.
Attribute type: Property. Number.
withReferenceTo: A sub-Relationship to the ID of a node (e.g., Junction, Sluice gate, Reservoir) from which the relevant position of the cross section is measured.
location: the geographic point of the cross-section.
crossSectionGeometry: Description of the geometry of a cross-section. Text defining the geometry of a channel. Values restricted to “Trapezoidal” (for open channels) or “Circular” (for pressurized flow) or “Irregular”.
leftSideSlope: A sub-property.
rightSideSlope: A sub-property.
bottomWidth: A sub-property.
maxWaterDepth: A sub-property.
diameter: A sub-property.
cross_section_Coordinates: An array describing [station, elevation].
targetURI: A sub-relationship. URI of a “channel” component from which the value of a property is obtained.

flow: Rate of flow in the cross-section.
velocity: Velocity in the cross-section.
quality: Quality parameter (temperature, turbidity, conductivity) in the cross-section.
depth: Water depth in the cross-section.
EnergyHead: the energy head in the cross-section.
PressureHead: for pressurized flow

CrossSection Relationships
attachedTo: A relationship to the ID of the channel where the cross-section “lives in”. Reference to an entity of type Channel.
observedBy: A relationship to the device that provides the flow, velocity, depth, quality and waterOutflow property value. Reference to an entity of type Device.
withReferenceTo: A sub-Relationship to the ID of a node (e.g., Junction, Sluice gate, Reservoir) from which the relevant position of the cross section is measured.
