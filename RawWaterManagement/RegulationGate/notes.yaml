notesHeader:
This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic “RegulationGate” made for raw-water supply management domain. Regulation structure consists a junction type object, controlling flow in a channel.

RegulationGate Entity Properties
id: Unique identifier (required).
description: An optional text that describes other significant information about the regulation gate.
tag: An optional text used to assign the regulation gate to a category, perhaps one based on age or the served area.

gateType: The type of the gate: specific values “SLUICE-GATE” or “RADIAL-GATE”.
gateWidth: the width of the sluice gate (m).
gateOpening: the height of gate opening (in meters or percentage). 
gateBottomElevation: Elevation of the bottom (crest) of the gate.
flowType: It defines the flow conditions in the gate. It takes the values: “OVERFLOW” (upstream water level exceeds the weir crest level), “FREE-FLOW” (water level is lower than gate edge),”SUBMERGED FLOW” (the rate of flow passing through the gate is regulated by the opening of the gate).
gateDischargeCoefficient: Gate discharge coefficient (m0.5/s) accounts for energy losses as water passes under the gate.
orificeDischargeCoefficient: Orifice discharge coefficient (m0.5/s) accounts for energy losses as water passes under the gate and the downstream tailwater increases to the point at which the gate is no longer flowing freely (downstream submergence is causing a greater upstream headwater for a given flow).
waterDischarge: the discharge that passes the weir (Q).
headDifference: the difference between the upstream depth and the depth just downstream.
upstreamControlPoint: Description of cross section just upstream of the sluice weir which controls the flow.
depth: A sub-property: the water depth just upstream of the sluice gate.
hasCrossSection: A sub-relationship indicating the ID of the cross section attached at this point.
justDownstreamControlPoint: Description of cross section just downstream of the sluice weir which controls the flow.
depth: A sub-property: the water depth just downstream of the sluice gate.
hasCrossSection: A sub-relationship indicating the ID of the cross section.
downstreamControlPoint: Description of cross section downstream of the sluice weir where the flow conditions become permanent.
depth: A sub-property: the water depth just downstream of the sluice gate.
hasCrossSection: A sub-relationship indicating the ID of the cross section.

RegulationGate Entity Relationships
observedBy: A relationship to the device that provides the gateOpening, upstreamDepth, downstreamDepth, flowRate. Reference to an entity of type Device.
hasCrossSection: A sub-relationship indicating the ID of the cross section.
curveDischargeCoefficient: A relationship to the ID label of the curve that represents the discharge Coefficient as a function of relative weir opening (weir opening over upstream depth), Cd over a/H1..
attachedTo: A relationship to the ID of the channel or the junction where the cross-section is attached to. Reference to an entity of type Channel.
