notesHeader:

This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic “regulation structure” made for raw-water supply management domain. Regulation structure consists a junction type object, controlling flow in a channel

RegulationStructure Entity Properties
id: Unique identifier (required).
description: An optional text that describes other significant information about the regulation structure.
tag: An optional text used to assign the regulation structure to a category, perhaps on its type. E.g., “L-gate” or “E-gate”.
location: the geographic point of the junction.
position: Description of relevant position of the regulation structure from a reference point.
Attribute type: Property. Number.
withReferenceTo: A sub-Relationship to the ID of a node (e.g., Junction, Sluice gate, Reservoir) from which the relevant position of the cross section is measured.
telecommand: Define whether the regulation structure is controlled remotely or manually. True/False value.
structureType: Determine the type of the structure. It takes specific values e.g., “Sluice Gates”.
numberOfGates: An integer value defining the number of gates attached to the regulation structures.
numberOfSpillways: An integer value defining the number of spillways attached to the regulation structure.

RegulationStructure Entity Relationships
hasGate: A relationship to the ID label of the gate.
hasSpillway: A relationship to the ID label of the spillway.
