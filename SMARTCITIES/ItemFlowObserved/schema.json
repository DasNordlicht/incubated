  "description": "The data model intended to measure an observation linked to the movement of an object at a certain location and over a given period. This Data Model proposes an evolution of two Data Model by merging them and integrating all the attributes of the initial version of [TrafficFlowObserved] and [CrowFlowObserved] and by extension any type of object that we want to analyze the movements. The value of the attribute `Type` can have different values corresponding to the `ObjectType` and the Flow Observed (Traffic, Crow, Bike, Boat, ...). The attribute `vehicleType` and `vehicleSubType` are modified to become a generic relations `itemType` and `itemSubType` or list of possible values. The relation will be directly defined by the 'urn:ngsi-ld':'itemType':xxxxxx' or 'urn: ngsi-ld:'itemSubType': xxxxxx' or list of data regarding standard for.",
