## Description

The Data Model is intended to provide information relating to the events listed in the `category` attribute and offers a Generic Data Model to events over a temporary period (eg: concert, exhibition, etc.) or to outings which correspond to a fixed place in the municipality (eg: theater, ...).
Depending on the value of the `category` attribute, common themes (eg : startDate & endDate / openingHoursSpecification / ...  ) or specific (pitch / performer / actors / criticReview / ...) are identified in dedicated sections.
For some attributes, lists of default values are proposed as first repository in order to better understand the meaning of the attribute.
